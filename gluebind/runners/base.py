"""Base class for the nested runner hierarchy.

``Calculation → Group → Stage → Window`` all subclass :class:`SimulationRunner`,
which provides a working directory and recursive ``setup``. Kept deliberately
light (a3fe's equivalent is much heavier): the orchestration logic — submission,
state, analysis — lives on :class:`~gluebind.runners.calculation.Calculation`,
while ``Group``/``Stage``/``Window`` mostly encode the tree and on-disk layout.
